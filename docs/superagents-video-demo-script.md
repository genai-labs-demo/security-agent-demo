## VIDEO 2: Hobbes - AI-Powered Penetration Testing (50 seconds)

**Summary:** We will show how we turned an infrequent and costly exercise into a regular and low-cost part of the development process.   We want to highlight:
 - how easy it is to get started (Just give it an endpoint + credentials)
 - how autonomous it operates (visualize all of the things happening invisibly under the hood)
 - how it thinks like a security engineer (developing series of linked exploits, techniques, or vulnerabilities that it chains together to progressively gain deeper access to a target system or network)
 - how it not only provides findings, but gives you the remediation code to fix the problem, speeding up your security process and improving the overall security posture.  
 - how it closes the loop with BW to implement the recommended changes *(maybe?)*.

**Voiceover:** AnyCompany’s security team has traditionally relied on an external company to support their penetration testing.  The cost and coordination have limited the frequency they can run them.  Hobbes changes that by making it simple for organizations to turn PenTests into a regular aspect of security posture.
**Visual:** We show a user navigating to the Hobbes PenTest page.

**Voiceover:** Getting started is as simple as providing the endpoint for the site, credentials, and a link to the source code *<validate?>* 
**Visual:** Shows the user configuring and launching the PenTest 

*<need to validate this step.  Is this realistic of how Hobbes works?>*
**Voiceover:** Hobbes autonomously explores the assets, understanding the code, and the design patterns, building a plan for  the testing.
**Visual:** This is an animation that will simulate how Hobbes is accessing the data from different systems (I’m thinking showing GitHub access, Confluence for design docs *<I think we can share these with it>,* the website itself, etc.

**Voiceover:** Unlike static security scanning packages, Hobbes thinks like a security engineer, linking exploits, techniques, or vulnerabilities to progressively gain deeper access to a target system or network.
**Visual:** This will be an animation to show some chain-of-thought style reasoning of how Hobbes works.  *<we may be able to pull some visuals from the Hobbes interface as it share its reasoning>* 




### Script Template:

**Voiceover:** "Meanwhile, a developer submits a PR for **[HUMAN_FEATURE]**. Hobbes automatically triggers on the PR, deploying it to a test environment. Traditional scanners would flag 52 issues - mostly noise. Hobbes? It's an AI agent that thinks like a security expert. It discovers the **[COMPONENT]** endpoints, tests authentication flows, and actively exploits vulnerabilities. Finding one: **[VULN_1]**. Finding two: **[VULN_2]**. Finding three: **[VULN_3]**. Hobbes blocks the PR, creates Jira security tickets for each finding, documents the exploits in Confluence, and alerts the developer in Slack with severity levels. The developer fixes the issues and updates the PR. Hobbes re-runs the test. All vulnerabilities patched. PR approved. Updates Jira, posts to Slack: 'Security verified.' Security issues caught before production, no manual pen-testing needed.“
